<div class="au-c-content">

The width utility can be used on all components but is commonly used in combination with the grid object.

## Fractions

The widths are calculated by fractions which are defined in `_s-global.scss`

### Examples
`.au-u-1-2`: 50%
`.au-u-3-5`: 60%

## Responsive

Each width utility can be made responsive by adding a breakpoint extension.

### Examples
`.au-u-1-2@medium`: 50% starting from the medium breakpoint
`.au-u-3-5@small`: 60% starting from the small breakpoint
