<div class="au-c-content">

Appuniversum is built upon the following principles. Please keep these in mind when contributing and/or using this framework.

## Low specificity
A single-depth-class-based architecture based on the [BEM](https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) naming methodology.

## Highly decoupled

Avoid reliance on other bits.

- **Separation of Concerns:** let each piece of code solve its own problems
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** one thing, one thing only, one thing well
- **Open/Closed Principle:** add via extension, not modification

## Keep it simple

- **The Principle of Least Surprise:** make sure expectations are met, and nothing else
- **Murphyâ€™s Law:** Pick the option that is the most resilient,
